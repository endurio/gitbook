# Bounty Hunting

To mine with Bounty, the miner must go to **Settings** and enable the **Bounty** option, which changes the BTC address type to **P2SH** (starting with **3** instead of **bc1**). Enabling or disabling this feature requires a Bitcoin transaction to transfer all BTC from the previous address type to the new one.

You can verify this by checking your Bitcoin deposit address, which now starts with **3** instead of **bc1**, as it did before.

In the **Mine** dialog, you will see the **Bounty** slider, which allows you to select the number of Bounty recipients to include in the transaction. The number of recipients affects both the transaction cost and the reward rate.

The **Bounty Hunting** transaction can include up to **8** bounty recipients, helping to increase protocol awareness.
