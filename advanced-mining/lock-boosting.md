# Lock Boosting

When relaying a transaction, a miner can choose to lock a portion of their reward in a savings contract for a selected duration, up to a maximum of two years. The unlocked portion can be claimed immediately as usual, while the locked portion accrues a boost based on the length of the lock period. The longer the lock duration, the greater the boost upon unlocking.

Miners who lock 80% of their mining rewards for 18 months will receive a +1440% (18 × 80%) reward boost, meaning they will earn 15.4 times more than a regular miner.

Referral commissions will be calculated based on the miner’s total boosted reward, incentivizing referrals while aligning rewards with long-term participation.
